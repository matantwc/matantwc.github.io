    <p>As a fighter pilot, you often find yourself forced unexpectedly into combat situations. Be it over rough and rocky terrain, oceans, deserts or even marshlands. Your mission is to rescue our stranded special-ops service men and women, but try not to worry too much, you have access to a full arsenal of rockets, bombs and a highly trained flight team, with their help you will bring our soldiers back, or die trying.

    <p>Heli Support is a physics based helicopter game. You must airlift objects and place them carefully to build a path for the tanks, or any other army vehicles. There are 12 levels, all with increasing difficulty. Keep an eye on your fuel meter too, as if you run out of fuel, your helicopter will crash and youâ€™ll fail the level. You can refuel by flying back to your base and landing gently. The controls for the ropes are a bit hard to master at first, but after some practice you'll soon become a pro at using them.</p></div>

   <p>Organize the busy skies and guide the planes and helicopters to a safe landing in Air Traffic Chief. Keep your cool and don't let the numbers overwhelm you and most of all, do not crash. If you like to land a plane just draw a route for him and wait till it lands using your mouse. Do this for all the planes and helicopters. You have three runways so it`s pretty hard to land many airplanes. Be focused and try to see every planes trajectory to avoid crashing.

Try to control your speed depending on how far the next obstacles are. Be careful of flames and other things that are sure to put a stop to your progress. Let's get flying.

<p>Flying a plane has never been easier...easier to access, that is! Prepare for the training of your life as you simulate, with your keyboard, the essence of flying a plane. Control your flaps carefully to maintain your altitude, and don't forget to keep an eye on your speed. If one little part is off, it could spell the end for your flying career, and your pilot!

<div id="kart"><iframe src="http://www.freeonlinegames.com/embed/21605" width="670" height="600" frameborder="no" scrolling="no"></iframe><p>Ever wished to fly a plane? Even better, ever wished to race one? We can't give you a plane, but 3D Stunt Pilot is certainly a great place to start! Race your plane through the courses in the fastest time possible. Use your mouse to move the plane and be sure to pass over the turbo boosters to break records!
